                <h1>What do you know about the cheetah?</h1>
                <p>The <dfn id="def-cheetah">cheetah</dfn> (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large, long-legged carnivore, and a member of the cat family.
                     They are found in Africa and small parts of Iran. The length of a cheetah can range from 40-60 inches, not including the 
                     tail. Their height can range from 28-36 inches. Their weight ranges from 75-125 pounds. Male cheetahs are larger and female 
                     cheetahs, but the difference is not always apparent to the untrained eye. Cheetah can be recognized by their lanky build 
                     and spotted tan or golden fur coat. They also have unique black stripes that go from the bottom of their eye to their 
                     mouth. Cheetahs can live on average from 10 to 12 years in the wild and 17-20 years in captivity. Cheetahs can growl, 
                     chirp, and purr; however, they do not roar (Cheetah Conservation Fund, 2021).</p>
            </div>

            <div id="speed">
                <h2>A cheetah's speed</h2>
                <p>A cheetah is the world's <strong>fastest</strong> land animal, with measured speeds reaching 65mph (105km/h) (Sharp, 1997). 
                This is faster than most cars! Similar to the greyhound, the cheetah has an anatomy build for speed. However, research showed 
                that a cheetah's forelimb muscles are even longer than that of the greyhound. They also have stronger flexor muscles, 
                responsible for their toes and claws, which allows them to propel off the ground faster (Hudson, 2011).</p>

            <div id="prey">
                <h2>Hunting and prey</h2>
                <p>Cheetahs in Africa usually prey on medium sized mammals weighing around 23-56 kg. These include blesboks, impalas, and 
                gazelles. They usually do not attack larger prey as there is a greater chance of getting injured (Hayward, 2006). Their 
                strategy is sneaking up on prey, then chasing their prey down in a short explosive chase. A successful chase ends with the 
                cheetah knocking their prey down and biting down on the prey's throat until it suffocates. (Caro, 1987)</p>
            </div>

            <div id="social">
                <h2>Social structure</h2>
                Male cheetahs live alone or in small groups, while females only live with their cubs. Cubs need a long time to learn how to 
                successfully hunt down prey and typically rely on their mother for food. They do not separate from their mother until they 
                are 14-18 months old (Caro, 1987).

            <div id="endangered">
                <h2>Threats to Cheetah Population</h2>

                <p>Cheetahs are currently listed as a vulnerable species according to the <abbr title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</abbr> Red List. 
                    The <dfn id="def-IUCN">IUCN Red List</dfn> is a list of wildlife species and their current status of endangerment. Many governments and organizations 
                    refer to this list in efforts to maintain biodiversity in the world.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Habitat destruction</li>
                    <li>Climate change</li>
                    <li>Hunting/Poaching</li>
                    <li>Lack of available territory</li>
                    <li>Genetic defects/low reproduction</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Cheetah population is on the decline. By 2016, the cheetah population in Asia has declined so much that their numbers are 
                    estimated to be less than 50. The population in Africa is estimated to be around 7000 only. Cheetahs require wide 
                    territories; however, in 2016 they only spotted in 9% of their past range (Durant, 2016).</p>
                
                <p>Cheetahs require wide areas to roam in for their territory, however humans have destroyed or intruded in much of their 
                    habitat. Climate change, hunting, and a genetically low rate of reproduction are also factors (National Geographic Society,
                     2020).</p>
                
                <p>Another problem that is pushing the cheetah species towards extinction is the lack of genetic diversity. The cheetah 
                    population is <dfn id="def-homozygous">homozygous</dfn>, meaning most members of the population have similar genes. Homozygosity is a result of inbreeding.
                     For example, animals such as domestic cats have a relatively low level of homozygosity in comparison. Homozygosity 
                     increases the risk for cheetahs to catch diseases, inherit recessive traits, and cause lower rate or inability to reproduce
                      (National Geographic Society, 2020).</p>
                
                <p>Conservation efforts for cheetahs prove difficult, as they require large land area and cannot share with other predators. 
                    While some cheetahs live in protected zones, most of them do not since they require such large roaming areas. (Durant, 2016)
                     Cheetah cubs face high mortality rates when they are conceived in an area containing many other predators, such as lions, 
                     leopards and hyenas. Cheetah cubs also face poaching by humans. Adult cheetahs can be killed by other cheetahs while 
                     fighting for territory, or by farmers (Cheetah Conservation Fund, 2021).</p>
                
                <p>For such a widely popularized and majestic animal such as the cheetah, the future of its species is looking rather grim.
                     Scientists are calling for the <abbr title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</abbr> to change the status of the cheetah from vulnerable to endangered, as certain types of 
                     funding are only available to endangered species. If the trend of its declining population continues, it may soon face 
                     extinction. Many organizations are actively trying to protect and save the future of this species. The cheetah is not only 
                     one of the world's most famous big cats, it is also a predator that is an essential part of the world's ecosystem.</p>
